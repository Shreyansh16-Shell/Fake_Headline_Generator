# Fake_Headline_Generator

This is a Python program that generates fake news headlines using predefined lists of words.

Overview:
The program randomly selects a subject (famous person, public figure, or common character), an action, and a place or situation to form a breaking news headline.

Credibility Meter:
Each subject and action is assigned predefined credibility points.  
The credibility of a headline is calculated using these points and displayed as a percentage along with a label.

Functionality:
Generate random fake news headlines  
Calculate credibility score (0–100%)  
Classify headlines as Fake News, Suspicious, or Likely Real  
Save generated headlines and credibility scores to a text file  

Overall, this project demonstrates basic Python concepts such as randomization, conditional logic, and file handling in a simple and engaging way.
